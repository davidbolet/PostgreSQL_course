# Final Practice — Design a Microservice Schema (Group Work)

**Goal:** End-to-end design for a small **Fulfillment** service.

## Deliverables
1) **Boundary & Ownership:** tables, constraints, and business keys.  
2) **Events:** outbox schema and example event payload(s).  
3) **Migrations:** one expand–contract change you anticipate.  
4) **Read Model:** a materialized view or projection table for one key endpoint.  
5) **Validation:** queries that prove invariants.
